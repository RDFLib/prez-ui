## Running Prez UI
There are several ways to use Prez UI's suite of features. The most common way to run Prez UI is by creating a 'themed' instance using `create-prez-app`. You can do so by running:

```bash
npx create-prez-app@latest <project_name>
```
_(Note: for pnpm, run `pnpm dlx` instead of `npx`)_

See the included README in the starter template from the above command, or the [theming documentation](./docs/theming.md) for more information on how to get started.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you're upgrading your Prez UI theme from < v4.2.0 to v4.2.0+, you will need to [follow the upgrade guide](./docs/upgrade.md) to upgrade to Tailwind v4, which is a breaking change.

> [!NOTE]  
> For v4.0.0 only, a few small changes need to be made to the starter template to be able to run your theme
> - the `prez-ui` dependency version should be set to `^4.0.0` ***before*** installing
> - if you're enabling the SPARQL page, copy the `sparql.vue` page from the prez-ui source code into your template and install [`@triply/yasgui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@triply/yasgui)

For other use cases, see the below packages that are available.
