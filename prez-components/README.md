# prez-components
This is the Vue.js component library for Prez UI. This library is installable with `npm` by running:

```bash
npm install 'https://gitpkg.now.sh/jamiefeiss/prez-ui-nuxt/prez-components?main'
```

This library contains dumb, display-only components for use in Prez UI and other Vue.js applications for presenting Linked Data. These components are easily overridable in Prez UI themes through the use of [Nuxt layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers).

The underlying component library used is [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/) in the meantime until a component library is decided on.

## Storybook
You can preview components in Storybook by running:

```bash
npm run storybook
```
