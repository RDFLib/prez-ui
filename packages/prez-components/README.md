# prez-components
This is the Vue.js component library for Prez UI.


This library contains dumb, display-only components for use in Prez UI and other Vue.js applications for presenting Linked Data, and utility components. These components are easily overridable in Prez UI themes through the use of [Nuxt layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers).

The underlying component library used is [PrimeVue](https://primevue.org/). The intention is to use tailwind css along with pass through properties for styling and theming.

## Storybook
You can preview components by running Storybook in the prez-showcase project:

```bash
cd packages/prez-showcase
npm run storybook
```
